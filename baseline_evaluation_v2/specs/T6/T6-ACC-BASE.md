## Task instruction / prompt given
"Heat up the bread, bring it to the master-bedroom desk, bring a water bottle and a clean towel and place them next to the bread. Turn off the living-room lights."

## Affected object(s)
- bread: bread_0; bottle: bottle_0; hand_towel: hand_towel_0 (green, clean). All three are uncertainty targets.
- lamp: lamp_0, the remaining task object representing living-room lights.
- No substitutes or distractors.

## Uncertainty being tested
- Internal robot memory: Accurate

## Information supplied in instruction
- Specifies one bread, one water bottle, one clean towel, the master-bedroom desk destination, adjacency to bread, and living-room lights off.
- Requests heating, which has no supported skill or success state.
- Omits source locations, furniture ids, towel color, and lamp count. Memory supplies exact sources. Bind master bedroom to bedroom_2 and desk to table_11.

## Initial world state
- bread_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), ordinary bread; no heated state modeled.
- bottle_0: on table_7 (dining_room_0), filled with water.
- hand_towel_0: on shelves_11 (bathroom_2), green, clean.
- lamp_0: on table_2 (living_room_0), powered on.

## Final expected world state
- bread_0: on table_11 (bedroom_2); no heating requirement.
- bottle_0: on table_11 (bedroom_2), filled with water, next_to bread_0.
- hand_towel_0: on table_11 (bedroom_2), green, clean, next_to bread_0.
- lamp_0: on table_2 (living_room_0), powered off.

## Initial robot memory
- bread_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), ordinary bread; no heated state modeled.
- bottle_0: on table_7 (dining_room_0), filled with water.
- hand_towel_0: on shelves_11 (bathroom_2), green, clean.
- lamp_0: on table_2 (living_room_0), powered on.

## Success criteria
- is_on_top(bread_0, table_11).
- is_on_top(bottle_0, table_11), is_filled(bottle_0), is_next_to(bottle_0, bread_0).
- is_on_top(hand_towel_0, table_11), is_clean(hand_towel_0), is_next_to(hand_towel_0, bread_0).
- is_on_top(lamp_0, table_2), is_powered_off(lamp_0).

## Spawn / planner notes
- Spawn bread ×1 on counter_0, bottle ×1 on table_7, hand_towel ×1 on shelves_11, and lamp ×1 on table_2. Initialize the bottle filled and the green towel clean.
- Use the spawned lamp for PowerOff, not ceiling fixtures. No other task lighting is modeled.
- Heating is unsupported: deliver bread without a heat action or heated-state check. Arrange objects next to one another, not stacked.
- Robot starts in living_room_0. No containment or distractors.
