# T4-INC-BASE

## Base task
Put all the 3 fruits from the kitchen counter in the fruit basket and the 2 drink containers on the kitchen counter.

## Scene
- scene_id: 107734176_176000019
- rooms used: kitchen_0
- furniture used (id — room — catalog description):
  - counter_0 — kitchen_0 — Kitchen island, 60x150x90

## Task instruction / prompt given
"Put all the 3 fruits from the kitchen counter in the fruit basket and the 2 drink containers on the kitchen counter."

## Affected object(s)
- apple: apple_0 is an uncertainty target omitted from memory; apple_1 is a remaining task object.
- bottle: bottle_0 is an uncertainty target omitted from memory; bottle_1 is a remaining task object.
- orange: orange_0 is a remaining task object.
- basket: basket_0 is the pickupable goal anchor.
- No substitutes or distractors.

## Uncertainty being tested
- Internal robot memory: Incomplete

## Information supplied in instruction
- Specifies three fruits, two drink containers, the fruit basket, the kitchen, and the counter.
- Specifies fruit source and goal arrangements, but omits instance ids, fruit species, and drink source.
- Instruction counts are not an inventory record of the omitted target instances.

## Initial world state
- apple_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable; not next_to basket_0.
- apple_1: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable; not next_to basket_0.
- orange_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable; not next_to basket_0.
- basket_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable.
- bottle_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable.
- bottle_1: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable.

## Final expected world state
- apple_0, apple_1, and orange_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), each next_to basket_0.
- basket_0, bottle_0, and bottle_1: on counter_0 (kitchen_0).
- Discover omitted targets through observation before relying on their locations.

## Initial robot memory
- apple_1: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable; not next_to basket_0.
- orange_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable; not next_to basket_0.
- basket_0: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable.
- bottle_1: on counter_0 (kitchen_0), pickupable.
- No inventory or location records are supplied for the two uncertainty targets. Omission is not evidence of absence.

## Success criteria
- is_on_top(apple_0, counter_0), is_on_top(apple_1, counter_0), is_on_top(orange_0, counter_0).
- is_next_to(apple_0, basket_0), is_next_to(apple_1, basket_0), is_next_to(orange_0, basket_0), all on counter_0.
- is_on_top(basket_0, counter_0), is_on_top(bottle_0, counter_0), is_on_top(bottle_1, counter_0).

## Spawn / planner notes
- Spawn apple ×2, orange ×1, basket ×1, bottle ×2, all on counter_0 at BASE positions.
- The catalog lacks a kitchen table; map that source to counter_0, the kitchen island, using a distinct drink-side region.
- Drink goals already hold in the world, though the selected bottle must be discovered to verify it. Start in kitchen_0.

## Constraints you MUST obey
- Do not delete targets from the world when deleting them from memory. Keep all remaining task objects in memory.
- Use next_to basket_0 on counter_0, not basket containment or stacking.
